<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm a 19-year-old who’s passionate about the future of technology—especially blockchain and cryptocurrency. 
  What started as a curiosity quickly grew into a deep interest in how decentralized systems work and their potential to reshape industries, finance, and even digital identity. 
  I spend much of my time learning about how different blockchain networks function, from consensus mechanisms to tokenomics.

<p>
  Beyond just theory, I enjoy exploring real-world use cases of crypto, including DeFi platforms, NFTs, and smart contracts. 
  I’ve joined online communities, engaged in discussions, and followed major updates in the space to stay ahead of trends.
  My goal is not only to understand how blockchain works but to eventually contribute to the space, whether through development, research, or community building.

<p>
  I believe the blockchain industry rewards those who are curious, open-minded, and willing to experiment—and that fits me perfectly. 
  As I continue to grow, I’m eager to connect with like-minded people, learn from projects shaping the future, and be part of the shift toward more open and decentralized systems.
